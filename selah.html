<div class="about">
<br>
<br>

<p> 
At The Holden School, a boarding school outside of Philadelphia, the student body is run by five factions. The factions provide everything Holden students need to deal with the challenges of adolescence while hiding their bacchanalia and debauchery behind school-sponsored blood drives and community service days.
</p>

<br>

<p>
The most powerful faction is The Spades, and Selah is its 17 year old hammer. Aided by her best friend Maxxie,Selah
and The Spades have long kept the system of factions in order. Driven by the desire for power as an end to itself, Selah is convinced that it is better to be feared than loved. In order to maintain control, she is willing to do whatever it takes to push her power past its limits.
</p>

<br>

<p>
At 15, Paloma is a sophomore and new to The Holden School. Though most comfortable in the background, she is
desperate to belong somewhere and to believe in something larger than herself. She is quickly intoxicated by Selah
and Maxxie’s high speed, colorful world. Gradually Selah begins to see Paloma as her natural successor – someone she can manipulate in the present – who can eventually lead the Spades after her graduation.

</p>

<br>

<p>
With the end of the school year approaching, Selah is confronted with the reality of a future without control. Maxxie’s
attention shifts away from The Spades, causing noticeable ruptures in the system of order that Selah has cultivated
over the years. And as Paloma journeys deeper into The Spades, she begins to own her new responsibilities and lead in a different direction from her predecessor. The student begins to outshine the master.
Selah becomes determined to reassert her power, no matter the cost.
